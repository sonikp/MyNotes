# Git + Homework

1. Create project in GitHub
2. Create project in eclipse
3. Within the eclipse workspace, in the project folder, initialize git:
$ git init

4. Register new project
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/sonikp/[reponame].git

5. Pull down project and info file from server
$ git pull origin master

6. Add all existing local files to the commit:
$ git add .      # this adds all the files

7. Make the initial commit, this stages all the files locally for the commit
$ git commit -a -m â€œInitial commit"

8. Move locally committed files to the remote project repo:
$ git push -u origin --all

Eclipes import the additional class files for the projects:

I've had a play with Eclipse to work this one out. Give the following a go:

1. Create the following directory structure (your desktop will do) classes/lec/utils
2. Place the InputReader class file in the utils directory.
3. Remove any references you have to InputReader you currently have in your build path.
4. Using (right click on project) Properties->Java Build Path->Libraries select the 'Add external class folder' and select the 'classes' folder you created on your desktop and click OK.
5. Now in the 'Referenced Libraries' in the project folder you should have one called 'classes' and a package path under that called 'lec.utils' which contains the InputReader class.
6. You can use that class using 'import lec.utils.InputReader' in you own class.
